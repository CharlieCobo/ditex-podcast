## Considerations and patterns used

it is pending to perform the unit tests with vitest & testing library, and the e2e tests with playwright, for the moment they have not been integrated so it takes a day of work and understanding the urgency of the request plus the time difference I prefer to send what I have and if you think well to finish them later.

# Thanks for your time!🙏🏽

and as last words, thank you for your time and the opportunity, it has been a very interesting challenge where I have proposed to leave my comfort zone, use other tools and try another point of view to solve the problem posed, in advance I am very grateful for any comments to improve, because I keep learning from each experience.
